              "RangerQuote": "At one time when small mines were in operation close to the western boundary of the Park this was one of the most difficult sections to control, there occurred constant poaching over its Western boundary on the part of both whites and natives from the mines, and by natives from the locations. Now that all the mines have closed down the first danger has been eliminated but the natives on the borders are ardent game killers and destroy many of our animals chiefly by snares when they stray far over the boundary. Indeed poachers have been caught 10 miles inside the boundary and it is only close guarding and patrolling that keeps these, people in check. Formerly, before we were in a position to safeguard this section by stationing a ranger there, large gangs with many dogs and even guns used to hunt far into the Park. At present the ranger of the No. 7 adjoining section is in charge and spends a portion of his time at Shangoni. This section is full of rare game such as buffalo and eland. There is no tourist rest camp and the ranger can therefore spend his undivided time looking after the safety of the wild animals.",

The Portuguese side of the border is only thinly inhabited, and holds enough game to keep the natives at home. On the other sides it is bordered by the K,N. Park. Formerly gangs of native hunters equipped with dogs, snares and bows and arrows used to penetrate from the west, and camp far up the Shingwedsi River; but the present ranger, shortly after taking over effectively put a stop to this practice.",

At one time white poachers occupied land adjoining but have now transferred elsewhere. The foot and mouth guards who form a cordon not far outside the boundary on the West are said to shoot any game they can. The Letaba farmers’ association who are constantly voicing -complaints re game coming from the Park are too far away to cause any personal trouble to the staff and in fact game breeds and exists in this area more extensively outside than inside the Park. There is little trouble from natives along the very thinly inhabited Portuguese border.",

However there being a good supply of game outside the Park and very few native inhabitants little trouble has accrued from this side in recent years. On the east lies Portuguese Territory and formerly there used to be a great deal of poaching from that side just as there was in the case of No. 4 section (Ranger Steyn). In 1925 one of our native rangers was killed and another seriously injured by Portugues native poachers. Since that time, when the offenders were captured on our representations, and sentenced to 14 years imprisonment by the Portuguese authorities (only one out of 12 survived to be released!) there have been no serious cases reported to this office. The position is in fact much like that in No. 4 section, according to the rangers' reports from each Section. There is a good deal of native traffic, illegal and otherwise, from P.E.A. especially since the WNLA recruiting stations closed down, and their transport ceased functioning.",

Some of the white owners are game protectionists others are not. There are relatively few natives on the western border living on the private farms, and as there is plenty of game outside the Park, practically no trouble i experienced on that side, either from whites or natives. In former years - up to about 1929 - there used to be a good deal of poaching along the border on the east by Portuguese natives culminating in a shooting affray in that year when a Portuguese poacher was killed. Since that, so far as reports have reached the Warden's office, at least, matters have been very quiet, though some years ago a coloured storekeeper from P.E.A. was said to be shooting game across our border fairly constantly. Beyond that the ranger has not communicated any serious poaching which he would no doubt, have done had it come to his notice.",

It is also, at its western end, faced by the above-mentioned Tenbosch native area with its population of hunting natives, and the Selati Line runs through the middle of it, implying a constant watch to be kept on the S.A.R. employees on the line, especially the native working gangs.
